"Now titled:   


# South Korea's lawmakers vote to lift president's martial law declaration

  
  
FTA: 

""Lawmakers in South Korea unanimously voted to lift a controversial martial law declared Tuesday by President Yoon Suk Yeol, reversing a dramatic decision that shook the nation.

Late Tuesday night, in a surprise TV address, Yoon declared an ""emergency martial law"" and accused the opposition of paralyzing the government with anti-state activities. He said the move was needed to protect the country. Yoon accused the left-leaning opposition of being sympathetic with North Korea and vowed to ""eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.""

Opposition leaders immediately denounced the martial law declaration as unconstitutional. Lawmakers quickly arrived at the National Assembly, the country's parliament, to reverse the president's decree as scores of protesters and lawmakers' aides attempted to block soldiers' entry into the main building. The National Assembly's 190 members unanimously voted to lift martial law. South Korea's constitution says the president should comply if a majority of the parliament votes to lift martial law.""",1733245515.0
"It was literally lifted within hours once the Legislature looked at him and called him an absolute nutter.

Also, I don‚Äôt know much about the constitutional makeup of South Korea, but I‚Äôm gonna guess it‚Äôs not as decentralized as our federal system.

Furthermore, counter insurgency doctrine calls for 20-25 soldiers per 1000 residents.

Oh that's right Trump spent 3 months claiming the election was stolen, throwing a temper tantrum, inciting his supporters and then they launched January 6th.

We can see which side does this when they lose and don't want to leave power. It's Trump and MAGA. We have the historical record. We have January 6th.

Show me the pictures of supporters of Democratic losing candidates beating cops with flag poles, breaking windows in the Capitol and trying to stop certification because their political candidate lost.

Absolutely.

If we're going to talk about good faith at least try not to misrepresent what's being said. That's an oddly peculiar way to put yourself on a pedestal but to each their own.¬†

"The thing is that you did blame migrants by saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôve allowed millions of criminals and terrorists before any American citizens gets harmed or killed‚Äù.

"I agree whole heartedly on ""Critical Thinking"" as being needed... and Education is a process that one can build the skill and capability to become a ""critical thinker"".    Critical Thinking is built upon and up from and through foundational information and knowledge about a particular subject matter, and in this case, the subject matter is:

1. Constitution based Representative Democracy¬†and
2. Constitutional based Republic Form of Representative Government.

I know and you know that a lot of people who have their claim of ""education and higher education"" may or may not have had any detail civic classes, and if was an elective, many people would not and did not elect it.

Many people have avoided civics courses, and some political science gets hung up on Party Politics, when nothing in the Constitution declares Parties, Political Parties are basically ""Lobbyist Groups"".

[Article I  Sections 1-9](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript), **does not** one single time mention a Political Party!!!
