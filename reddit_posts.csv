The 4B Movement in South Korea Is More Prevalent Than You Think (Rant from a Random Korean Woman),"

Hi, I’ve recently come across numerous claims suggesting that the 4B movement isn’t popular in South Korea, and I felt compelled to address this misconception even with the hassle of creating a dedicated Reddit account just for the rant. For those unfamiliar, the 4B movement—short for the “Four No’s”: no dating, no sex, no marriage, and no childbearing—is a stance some Korean women are adopting in response to deep-rooted gender inequalities.

To outsiders, it might seem like the 4B movement lacks traction here. After all, when the so-called experts point to our declining birth rates, they often attribute it to the highly competitive culture or economic pressures, dismissing any influence from movements like 4B. But let’s set the record straight.

We’re talking about a country where a woman’s career can be jeopardized for something as innocuous as wearing a T-shirt that reads “Girls Do Not Need a Prince” or for liking a Women’s March post on Twitter—even if it was seven years ago. I’m not exaggerating; incidents like these have occurred as recently as last year; we’re talking about literal termination of a contract due to a heart made on a post regarding woman’s safety issue on Twitter dating back to seven or more years ago due to incel gamers throwing a fit. Such a climate makes it perilous for women to openly discuss feminist movements or critique societal norms. (And I don’t feel safe discussing 4B in English on Reddit either so I’m creating a whole new account just to write this rant.)

In order to protect ourselves, many of us treat discussions about 4B like a clandestine topic—like a secret underground society of anonymous agents with a mask and a blood oath, meeting on every other moon. When family or relatives ask about our personal choices, we often respond with a simple “그냥” (“just because”), rather than delving into the real reasons that could invite scrutiny or backlash.

Consider this: According to a Korean survey conducted in 2020, a quarter of single households indicated they have no plans to marry in the future. When asked why, 28.9% of the men who had answered so cited financial limitations as the main reason, while 31.6% of women replied “just because.” This isn’t apathy; it’s self-preservation.

We reserve our candid discussions about 4B and our perspectives on men for secure, heavily-vetted spaces; anonymous online threads or between the closest of girlfriends. However, the reluctance to speak openly doesn’t equate to a lack of belief or participation in the movement.

To further underscore my point, consider the findings from a 2023 research conducted by 한반도미래연구원 later published by a major South Korean news outlet (경향신문):
1. Among unmarried young adults aged 20 to 39, 4 out of 10 stated they have no intention to marry.
2. This sentiment is particularly pronounced among women and those in their 30s.
3. In their 20s, 33.2% of men and 46.1% of women expressed no intention to marry.
4. In their 30s, these numbers rise to 41.0% of men and a significant 56.6% of women who do not plan to marry.
5. Notably, 16.3% of women in their 30s said they would “absolutely never get married,” nearly double the percentage of men in the same age group at 8.7%.

These statistics reveal a growing, yet often unspoken, sentiment among Korean women regarding marriage and societal expectations.

So, before dismissing the 4B movement as unpopular or insignificant in South Korea, consider the cultural and societal factors that compel many women to stay silent. The movement is very much alive; it’s just not always visible on the surface.",5495,302,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1goa8j6/the_4b_movement_in_south_korea_is_more_prevalent/,2024-11-10

got a south korean girl pregnant during a hookup its mine,"So, in November of 2023, I posted on here that I traveled to South Korea with my friends and stayed there for a month. I met a Korean girl, hooked up with her, and two days before we left, she told me she was pregnant. Most of the comments told me I should go back and get a DNA test. I built up the courage, and on September 3, I booked a flight with my friend. We got there and texted her through Instagram, where she was keeping me updated with the baby, even though I was suspicious. Surprisingly, she wasn't upset with me; she was happy I was there. Anyways, I immediately asked for a DNA test, and it took three days to get the results. I was scared, nervous, and felt sick. Finally, the results came back - it's me, I'm the father. Not gonna lie, my heart dropped, I was sweating, shaking, and on the verge of tears. I came back home after being there for one week. I told her I needed to go home and think for a while. She said, and I quote, ""Ok, but please do what's right for our daughter."" It's been about two weeks since I've been back, and I genuinely don't know what to do. I still like her, but I live in America; it's not like I can just move there. I'm still so naive to so many things. Please give me some advice; I'm stressing.


Update : So, I've been getting a few DMs saying I fetishize Asians. Let me tell you how I even thought about going to South Korea. Around October of 2022, I decided to walk to a Korean restaurant that's four minutes away from my apartment and get some food. I enjoyed the food so much that I would go once or twice a week. Eventually, I grew close to the son, who was 20 at the time, and his mom. They're both Korean American. After being friends with him for a while, he asked if I wanted to take a trip to South Korea. For a while, I thought about it and eventually said yes. And that's how everything went down. I don't fetishize Asians. Korea was the first Asian country I've been to. I had only been to the UK and Mexico before. I'm talking with her, and we're figuring something out. I will let you guys know what will happen.

Update: I want to thank everyone who genuinely gave me advice. After talking with her, we both decided it's best if I go to Korea for a bit and be there for my daughter and build a relationship with her. She’s willing to get me Korean lessons and everything I need to make sure I am the best for my daughter. My family agrees I need to be there for her. I still need to figure out some things with my work, but that will come in time. Also, thank you to everyone who private messaged me. It really woke me up. Wish me luck, and check my page—I posted a picture of me and her. I want y'all to see us. Thank y'all so, so much.😊

"South Korean stocks down 6% today on South Korea declaring martial law, buy the dip","The news sounds scary, but it's just the president declaring martial law because he's upset that his opposition won, and because they are launching a corruption investigation into him/his wife, so he's trying to paint them as North Korea supporters. There's no actual emergency, North Korea hasn't done anything, it's just lame duck president stirring up trouble.

South Korean markets were already insanely cheap before this dip, trading at 11-12x earnings, compared to 31x earnings for the US markets.

Positions: Buying EWY today

edit: I bought EWY at $53-54. It's at $55.50 now, I wouldn't buy above $55 unless the situation is resolved and fx rates recover, because IMO korean stocks will dip when their market opens.

edit 2: Korean Parliament voted to overturn the martial law declaration, also their Finance Minister stated that unlimited liquidity injections and other measures will be enacted if necessary to maintain stability. I'm holding for now, but refraining from buying more unless it dips below $54 again.

edit 3: Military is saying martial law still in effect until the president cancels it. I'm being cautious, sold some at $55.30 but still holding most, not buying any more at this price bc at this point most of the remaining drop can be attributed to fx rates, I think Koreans will dump stocks when their market opens in the morning.

Edit 4: president says he'll end martial law. That was fun. ez gains. At this point the drop in price is roughly equal to the Korean won's depreciation, suggesting that the market is pricing the korean market opening flat. I'm still bullish long term on Korea but I can definitely see a dip after hours when the Korean market opens.",2022,388,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h5pp4u/south_korean_stocks_down_6_today_on_south_korea/,2024-12-03
inggit na inggit ako sa south korea,"whats happening there is so unfortunate pero as i was scrolling through live updates sa nangyayari sa south korea kagabi, di ko mapigilan mainggit ng sobra sobra. their politicians woke up at midnight, ran to the parliament building, and climbed walls para lang maoverturn yung declaration ng martial law. the citizens literally lifted them up the walls para makapasok, senior citizens stopped military trucks by standing in the way, women were at the scene helping barricade the building habang yung mga lalaki talaga nakikipagstand off just to let their politicians enter the building. it also helped that despite the country being under martial law hindi super violent yung mga sundalo nila and was practicing restraint against the civilians.

i know they'll be going through so much more sa aftermath pero after witnessing south koreans protect their democracy so fiercely, i cant help but feel envy. grabe ang OA ko pero naawa ako bigla sa pilipinas, even imagining our people doing the same thing feels impossible. if that was the philippines puro vloggers makikita mo on the scene spreading propaganda to justify it. ang sad lang kasi filipinos deserve better pero its so clear na we have such a long way to go.

MT: South Korea Martial Law ,"On December 3, 2024, South Korean [President Yoon](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/QBE9jj1Ba5) Suk Yeol [declared emergency martial law](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/BRUwzhNUzj), citing threats from North Korean communist forces and domestic anti-state elements. In a televised address, he authorized the military to maintain order, accusing the opposition Democratic Party of paralyzing the government and labeling them as anti-state forces. 

He has tried to block the National Assembly so they cannot vote to undo it, [they](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/g2r2M82nuY) are [trying to vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/Ko6SGBMMNA) to undo it. In specific, the military, under General Park An-su as Martial Law Commander, has suspended activities of the legislature, local councils, and political parties, placing media and publications under martial law control. Medical personnel have been ordered to return to work within 48 hours amid an ongoing junior doctors' strike. 

Han Dong-hoon, leader of the President's own People Power Party, [opposed the declaration](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-12-03/national/politics/Martial-law-is-wrong-Han-Donghoon-pledges-to-stop-Yoon-Suk-Yeol/2191865), vowing to stop it alongside the people.

This marks the first imposition of martial law in South Korea since its democratization in 1987, raising significant concerns about the country's democratic governance and civil liberties.

Emergency Martial Law declared in South Korea,"**Martial Law has now been lifted**

Initial post:

Nationwide festivals and events are being canceled. Entertainment agencies informing artists not to attend schedules starting tomorrow.

I'm not sure what this is going to mean for K-pop in the short term

EDIT: I did not mean to trivialize this issue by making it about K-pop. I made the post while still learning about the situation. My understanding of how all of this works in Korea was pretty limited. I should have thought through it more or waited for someone more well-informed to make a post. My bad.

I'm praying for everyone within South Korea. I'm hoping for this to de-escalate as soon as possible. 

The president is violating so many human rights and misusing his power. I hope the National Assembly is able to reconvene soon and put an end to this madness. 

I appreciate all the folks who are providing good quality information in the comments. 

Please feel free to reach out to me if there is an authoritative article about this that needs to be shown right at the top. 


EDIT 2: Please refer to u/FallPhoenix18 comments for updates. 

From some of the comments on here and what I'm seeing on Twitter, it looks like members were able to go in and vote against the martial law in the National Assembly. This is great news. I hope this gets resolved soon.

There is a youtube channel that has notoriously spread misinformation on his channel, many feminists are in danger because of the rampant misogyny and the rise of sex crimes happening in South Korea right now, yet the channel dismisses it and even bullies the feminists for pressuring the government to do something about it.

South Korean here,"I'm sure a lot of people who aren't Korean here are wondering what's going on in my country. Hell, even some of my Korean friends doesn't know what is going on

Before I speak, I just want to clarify something. I don't like talking politics, especially here. I don't side with one particular political side, they're all assholes in my eyes. I'm not siding with particular politician or anything, I just want to go over what's going on and how it will affect our beloved Nikke

First, this declaration of martial law likely won't last. If majority of the national assembly disapprove the martial law, the president is forced to lift it. The assembly just voted, 190 out of 300 national assembly lawmakers participated in the voting and all 190 lawmakers disapproved the martial law. If the president doesn't lift the martial law despite this, it goes against the constitution which is more than enough reason for him to be relieved of his duty and forced to step down. So one way or another, this martial law won't last long

Second, this will be negative for South Korean economy. Foreign investors were already wary of investing in South Korea due to the risk of war with North Korea. Thus declaration of martial law won't help. Our economy was already shit but now the president is just pouring fuel to the fire that is our collapsing economy. The exchange rate between US dollar and S.Korea won is already going crazy (God I wish I invested in some US stock market more). This will be bad for SU and every other South Korean companies, really. Samsung was already doing very poorly this year so the company owners will definitely not like this at all

So Nikke service will continue but ShiftUp as a company will be negatively affected by this. How will they respond to this? I don't know. Maybe increase the price on gacha skins? Who knows. But long story short, the game itself will continue to provide service, this martial law isn't due to anything like a terrorist attack or war. I won't go over why the president suddenly decided to declare the martial law but long story short, he's doing this to save his own skin. He would rather put the entire country into chaos just to gain some power, his approval rating was hitting rock bottom. Even his own political party didn't know he would do such thing and are disapproving him, this martial law won't last long. We'll have to wait and see to know anything for certain. As someone who lives here, I just want this asshole to step down, either willingly or forcefully. He has 0 qualities of a leader; he doesn't listen to criticisms, he doesn't communicate with the people, he doesn't understand what the people need nor willing to understand, he uses tax money as if it's his own, and he uses foreign meetings as an excuse to have a vacation. I don't blame people who voted him, it was either this asshole or a known criminal (yeah our politics is fucked) but God I wish this asshole just come down

If this goes against community rules and mods take it down, so be it. I just wanted to let everyone know what is going on here",1617,173,https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/comments/1h5sc6e/south_korean_here/,2024-12-03

Hi, u/BanterBoat here, and welcome to the one of the two final games of Group F! The ""Group of Death"" can see any of the four sides qualify or be eliminated, so there's everything to fight for at this stage of the competition! 

Germany look fierce after an epic late comeback win vs Sweden (courtesy of Toni Kroos), while South Korea will be looking to get some points on the board after a spirited performance against Mexico (with the obligatory Son banger). Anything can happen, so hopefully we'll see a little bit of World Cup magic for an all-time classic match we'll tell our kids about.

- According to [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-world-cup-predictions/), Germany has an 87% chance at progression, while Korea stands at a mighty 1%.
- Germany need a win that equals or betters Sweden (should they win) in order to advance; Korea must beat Germany AND Mexico must beat Sweden, givetn hat at least one of the results is by a margin of two goals
- Interestingly enough, although the Group after D is E, Group F's games are being played earlier than Group E (if there's some kind of reason, please let me know)

North Korean Defector Who is Sending Information to North Korea,"My name is Park Il Hwan and I am a North Korean defector who is working on the activist movement for ""information dissemination."" I settled in South Korea in 2001 and I majored in law at Korea University. My father gave me a dream. This was a difficult dream to bear while under the North Korean regime. He said, ""If you leave this wretched country of the Kims and go find your grandfather in the U.S., he'll at least educate you."" ""The dream of studying with blue-eyed friends"" was a thought that always made me happy. Enmeshed in this dream, I escaped North Korea all alone without a single relative. This was something my dad had said to my 15-year-old self after having a drink, but this seed of a ""dream"" became embedded deeply in my mind, and as the years went by, it grew so strongly that I couldn't help but bring it to action. I thought carefully about why I wanted this so desperately to risk my life. The words of my father that ""changed my consciousness"" was ""information about the outside world."" The genuine solution to the North Korean issue is the ""change of consciousness"" of the North Korean people. To resolve the issue of North Korean nuclear weapons, there may be different opinions between the Democrat and Republican parties, but despite the change in administration, ""information dissemination"" in North Korea is a movement that must continuously go on. When looking at issues of Muslim refugees or ISIS that show the appearances of clash of civilizations, the above can be said with even more conviction. In the end, even if a totalitarian regime is removed, if there is no ""change in consciousness"" of the people as a foundation, diplomatic approaches or military methods to remove a regime are not solutions for the root issue. The change that I experienced through the ""information dissemination"" that we do to send in USBs or SD cards to North Korea, thus the ""change of consciousness"" among the North Korean people, must be established first as a foundation. Please refer to the link below to find out more details about our ""information dissemination"" work. On Wednesday, December 7th from 10AM - 11AM KST (Tuesday, December 6th 8PM - 9PM EST), I'll be answering your questions. Thank you.

South Korea population decline.,"This is more of a rant, but without fail, every single time you see an article about the population decline in South Korea, a ton of non-Korean men chime in.       

They really think more money and better working conditions would have women popping kids out consistently.          

Every single one of my Korean friends cite *men* being the specific reason they’re refusing to have relationships and kids(4B movement). The extreme misogyny, the expected infidelity, the casual abuse etc. are the main reasons a lot of women there want nothing to do with the domestic life.        

I’m sure expense and lack of job security/way too many hours, play a roll for some of them, but it’s deeply frustrating when men act as though money is the only thing women need. They don’t want money, they want to be treated like human beings.          

Even their government is dehumanizing them, insisting on the dumbest, most misogynistic policies to push women and girls into breeding earlier.",1419,189,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1djmn23/south_korea_population_decline/,2024-06-19
What's going on with South Korea's insistence that Kim Jong Un is alive and well?,"Most of the questions with ""Kim Jong Un"" in the title on this sub are asking about the memes, so hopefully, this isn't a repetitive question.

I've recently seen media outlets reporting on statements from South Korea's unification minister, Kim Yeon-chul, maintaining that Kim Jong Un is doing well. 

Is this because South Korea is the only country that has information regarding his health and is, therefore, the only source of news on this matter? Or is South Korea trying to keep the situation from getting out of hand due to the potential fallout if Kim Jong Un were to die?

EDIT: Thanks for all the answers, everyone! I wish I had more input, but I really know nothing about politics or diplomacy. Your guys’ explanations and discussions have been great reads!

Here are a few articles I've read:

[Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/korea-urges-caution-kim-jong-rumours-200427024748691.html)

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/04/27/kim-jong-un-alive-and-well-south-korean-official-says-amid-illness-rumors/3032122001/)

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/world/asia/kim-jong-un-health.html)",9583,521,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/g96nog/whats_going_on_with_south_koreas_insistence_that/,2020-04-27
South Korea has begun implementing fairly aggressive birth promotion policies.,"[https://v.daum.net/v/20240717143607620](https://v.daum.net/v/20240717143607620)

This article is in Korean, but if you translate it, it is a policy that discriminates between recently born and non-born households in the apartment subscription system.

The article also includes this part.

''The subscription system was designed to clearly divide the chances of winning the subscription depending on whether or not you have children,''

'' Now, it is a policy that feels like you have to have children(Born within the last 2 years) to win the apartment subscription.

In fact, the price of houses in Korea has increased tremendously, and since these subscriptions set the selling price much lower than the actual transaction price, winning the housing subscription can result in a price difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars (In other words, having a recent child means you can buy a house for hundreds of thousands of dollars less, effectively making hundreds of thousands of dollars more.), and this is probably a evidence of the natalism policy.

It is actually showing effects.

[https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/023/0003831611?sid=102](https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/023/0003831611?sid=102)

This is also a Korean article, but if you translate it, it says that visits to infertility centers have skyrocketed this year and that in vitro fertilization has surged by 30%.

In addition, according to recent statistics, the number of applications for welfare services available to pregnant women has skyrocketed by 20-30%. You can see that the number of pregnant women has skyrocketed this year. This is because they have started implementing policies that indirectly discriminate against non-birthing households. This is just one example, and these policies are seen in all areas.

The same goes for marriage. Korea is probably starting to use the strongest natalism policy in the world right now, and it seems to be starting to work. The birth rate may skyrocket in a few months.",988,178,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1fmogfc/south_korea_has_begun_implementing_fairly/,2024-09-22
Over 150 South Korean elementary schools have no 1st graders,"[https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240226050665](https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240226050665)

I know this is a common topic here, but I feel like this metric is even more shocking. South Korean women seem to be on the front line of the result of misogyny. This should be a cautionary tale to the world about where all of this violence and oppression of women. However, the discourse seems to be that women are the problem still. (I'm not surprised, just very disappointed)

This is all framed as misandry, which is fundamentally absurd. The argument of these men is that women should be more wiling to be impregnated. Because women want to be valued as human and not as breeding cows, they equate this misandry. However, there seems to be a refusal to acknowledge this is happening because of the poor treatment of women that has been going on for generations.

It's good to keep these kinds of things visible. For solidarity with the South Korean women who refuse to be sex slaves for men, and to put a magnifying glass on the nigh final result of rampant, unchecked misogyny.

The SK media panders to these misogynistic takes to the extreme. They go as far to try and de-platform Korean women because they didn't like how they held a piece of chocolate, all the way to men flooding the streets to protest a video game because a girl character makes a pinching emote and they say this is the game devs secretly telling them that their dick is small.

Hi, u/BanterBoat here, and welcome to the one of the two final games of Group F! The ""Group of Death"" can see any of the four sides qualify or be eliminated, so there's everything to fight for at this stage of the competition! 

Germany look fierce after an epic late comeback win vs Sweden (courtesy of Toni Kroos), while South Korea will be looking to get some points on the board after a spirited performance against Mexico (with the obligatory Son banger). Anything can happen, so hopefully we'll see a little bit of World Cup magic for an all-time classic match we'll tell our kids about.

[](#sprite6-p90): Son Heung Min (손흠민): Undoubtedly Korea's greatest asset in this World Cup, he's been hindered by a lack of support- however, with a goal against Mexico and mandatory military service on the horizon, he will be more motivated than ever to pull of an upset. The question is, will his teammates step up? Kim Shin Wook (the tree) and Koo Ja Cheol have been disappointing, while Hwang Hee Chan has looked impressive at times and completely wasteful at others- Lee Jae Song and Lee Seung Woo have looked solid but largely inconsequential. Ki Seung Yung has always been Korea's reliable defensive stalwart, but Korea could really use an attacking midfielder to feed passes into the wings or take shots (Korea registered only 2 shots against Sweden, both of which were off target). A blend of defensive prowess and clinical finishing could be the formula to bring a largely uninspiring Korea side to the Round of 16.

[](#sprite6-p64): ~~Thomas Muller/~~Timo Werner: These two German attackers were predicted to run riot in the tournament, yet have not registered a single goal between the two of them. If they can find their footing in this match, it could very well spell the end for Korea's advancement hopes and a beginning to Germany's attempt to defend their title. Germany have looked much more solid during the game against Sweden, and their past performances in final group stage matches points to a win. If either attacker can play to their full potential alongside a fit Marco Reus and confident Toni Kroos, they should be easily able to overwhelm the lesser quality opposition. If Germany can play their normal football, it should be more than enough for the Round of 16, given Sweden do not win by a larger goal margin.

Edit: Oh dear, Muller has been dropped. In that case, definitely look at Goreztka, who will be looking to capitalize on his start; he has the potential to burst with pace and be very skillful in the box, and with Korea's history with VAR, a Germany penalty in the second half is a very realistic scenario. 

Note also that Ki is injured, so that's a defensive liability for Korea, who is playing... Jang Hyun Soo in the CDM position, one of their least confident players.

"MMW: Putin's little visit to Kim in North Korea will prove to be one of the greatest blunders of the entire Ukraine war.  South Korea, previously mostly not involved but selling things to Ukraine and Poland, sees this as an existential threat and will flood Ukraine with assistance. ","Russia needs bullets and bodies.  These are the things that DPRK can provide them.  In return, Russia provides DPRK with missie/space tech, oil, energy, and food, things which DPRK needs.  

Russia and DPRK signed a mutual assistance pact, meaning just like NATO an attack on one is an attack on the other.  This is of course not helpful to Russia at all because DPRK is not capable of launching any attack on any nation other than South Korea, but it greatly unbalances the Korean Peninsula power balance.  

South Korea had previously been mostly uninterested in Ukraine, because it doesn't affect their own situation at all, other than to get in good graces with the US and Western Europe, and develop good business ties, and to show off the superior weapons of the South Korean MIC.  

Putin's visit was a huge slap in the face to South Korea, and creates a huge security crisis for them, upsetting the balance.  South Koreans are majorly pissed about it.  Now that they are pissed, you already see them throwing their support behind Ukraine.  

We all know that the battlefield situation in Ukraine is essentially a balancing act.  Whichever side has more artillery, weapons and manpower will make the advances on the battlefield.  The recent influx of assistance gave Ukraine a slight edge, but they are still on the defense but are absolutely annihilating Russians in the Kharkiv direction.  

South Korea providing additional assistance in the form of 155mm artillery shells, advanced weapons and other material could be the straw that breaks the camel's back in the war.  If Ukraine is ever able to achieve parity in terms of artillery with the Russians, it's over for Russia.  With additional weapon systems such as more MLRS and precision munitions, Ukraine can demolish Russian forces on the Russian side of the border while they amass to attack.  

Putin's trip to North Korea was monumentally stupid. ",910,185,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkMyWords/comments/1dnlcig/mmw_putins_little_visit_to_kim_in_north_korea/,2024-06-24

"I’m Joong Sik Eom MD, a physician treating COVID-19 patients at a hospital near Seoul. I serve on a team advising the South Korean government’s pandemic response. AMA.","[*Annyeonghaseyo,*](https://youtu.be/w9-xtdwUGS8?t=10) I’m Dr. Joong Sik Eom, infectious diseases physician and professor at the [Gacheon University College of Medicine](http://medicine.gachon.ac.kr) in Incheon, South Korea. I also serve as a member of the national “COVID-19 Response Academic Advisory Council” that advises the South Korean government’s ongoing rapid-response efforts. The idea for the [drive-through testing sites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX3-KXWmzzs) came from our group.

At the [Gil Medical Center](https://www.gilhospital.com/) where I practice, we are treating severe COVID-19 cases. I have a few patients under my direct care in their 70s to 90s and recently sent someone home after a full recovery.  

Starting at 10am EST, I’ll do my best to answer your questions about COVID-19 in Korea, perhaps on: the public-private response, the healthcare burden, testing coordination, technology, public messaging, medical treatments, cultural factors, facemasks, and the road ahead. I am pleased to have language translation support today from student scientists Ms. Chaerin Yim and Ms. Yunha Jo. 

In COVID-19, humanity now faces a common enemy. We will defeat it faster if we can work together as global citizens, reaching across boundaries to offer knowledge and support. My hope is that our experience here in Korea could be somehow useful to you all. AMA.

EDIT: It's now 1am and I've got to call it a night and get some sleep. Thank you so much for your great questions and interest. I wish all of you great health! [*Gamsahamnida.*](https://youtu.be/w7Cm5Vd8pGM?t=10)

"UPDATE: Would you move to Seoul, South Korea for ~$130k yr?","I posted this last year and ended up taking the job. We've been here almost a year and figure I'd provide an update. 

Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3agse9/would_you_move_to_seoul_south_korea_for_130kyear/

Overall things are good. The actual moving process was pretty smooth. We only ended up bringing about 5000 lbs of our goods with us. It was paid for and arrived about 6 weeks after we arrived without any incident. 


As for the job, the work is a bit more complicated and demanding than what I was prepared for. It has taken me almost a year to start to feel confident and comfortable in what I'm doing. My workweek is generally 40 hours with occasional overtime expected during certain months. 


Seoul is an awesome place to live. Public transportation is reliable and cheap. Restaurants are very affordable considering there are additional tax nor tips. We've found the Koreans to be friendly, the elderly are generally very playful with our kids. We are trying to learn Korean but with the demands of work and a new baby, we have fallen short of our goals. Getting around is still very manageable with limited Korean, as lots of people speak at least some English. The expat community is very tight knit and we have made many multicultural friends.


From a financial standpoint the move has been very beneficial. I have been able to increase my retirement contributions by an additional 3%, put away additional money for a down payment and my children's college funds. We recently travelled to Japan and intend on going to Vietnam or Thailand later this year. Family has come to visit on two occasions and others are planning trips. 


I'd say the biggest drawback has been my son's schooling. He attends a US Govt school and it has been a challenge. He has suspected ASD/ADHD and the school administrators have fought us at almost every turn in our attempts to get him the services he requires per his IEP (given the employment situation, US education laws still apply). We have the option to school him in other International schools but based on my understanding of Korean schools, it wouldn't be a better situation. It's also worth noting that the educational services he was receiving before we left were also less than stellar. 

Overall I have no regrets with the move and we are looking forward to staying 4 more years.",4304,755,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4szut2/update_would_you_move_to_seoul_south_korea_for/,2016-07-15
I read Starship Troopers when I was in high school back in South Korea in the 90s. And I didn't have any cultural resistance towards the philosophy presented in the novel.,"I think it was an unauthorized translation from the Japanese version. And around the same time period I also watched the anime adaptation of the novel. (A bootleg from a laserdisc) 

Honestly, I didn't have any negative feelings towards the society presented in the novel because...corporal punishment was a normal part of Korean life in the 80s and 90s. And also mandatory conscription was a very normal thing. In fact, it was a rite of passage for men in Korea. 

The concept of the enemies that cannot be reasoned with wasn't really an alien concept to me. South Korea really didn't have the moment that defined the end of the cold war and back in 1994, Korean peninsula was on the verge of a full scale war. (Clinton administration stopped it, fortunately or not) 

So I do have a very different reaction to the modern American readers of the novel. And in fact, it was very difficult to believe that Heinlein ended up subscribing to libertarianism. I got the impression that he toyed with a lot of different ideas through his life. ",381,240,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/1flr0vt/i_read_starship_troopers_when_i_was_in_high/,2024-09-21
Solidarity from South korea,"Hi, I am woman in late 20s from south korea. I watched the news that man got elected again thanks to shameless racism and blatant misogyny. Not a surprise. Also saw lots of mentioning of 4B here and there.  Which leads me to here! And wow, I don’t come to reddit often and english is not my first language, so didn't know 4B thing is reaching people from different cultures. It’s astonishing.

About “4B”, if you ask korean walking down the street, then probably most of them would say they are not aware of it. It’s because any issue regarding feminism is heavily tabooed in this society and the term “4B” is actually quite used in limited communities.

But whatever you call it, It is very much real in korea.  
Everyone is aware of the serious gender issue, increase of incel and result of those, the plummeting birth rate. But we don’t talk openly about it. At least men don’t, because it means they admit the issue.

Some people still seems to not grasp the severe implication of 0.6-0.7 birth rate.  
We’ve never seen this number even during the Korean war, when life was much more difficult and economically challenging. Lower than recent russia’s or ukraine’s birth rate.Let that sink in. Cost of housing and living is NOT the issue. It could be one of many reasons but not the main reason.

On some level, we are aware that the plummeting birth rate could mean a dark future, economic trouble for our country.  
But those who opened their eyes, those who thought ‘enough is enough’, they rather decided to “go extinct” than submit to rampant misogyny, patriarchy, and give what abusers want.  
Look into the numbers of Korean women killed or beaten by men (not even in a relationship) monthly and yearly, then you will understand.   
Look at the wage difference, and incel's astoricities. I’d rather die alone peacefully than be constantly terrified of the possibility of betrayal and violence from men. Naturally females tend to not reproduce in a bad environment anyway, so… what the world looks like lately doesn’t help lol.

If they try to treat you like a reproductive machine or malfunctioning home appliance or something, then punch them with the same method. Malfunction hard, I’d say.  
That is what I think 4B means. Refusing to give any of your resources, time and attention to fuckers.

Anyway 4B is not the only way to fight, and 4B, 6B, or not, I just wanted to say your rage is valid. What you feel is valid. Your body, your choice. Fuck all of them.They will scream at you, ridicule you, belittle you, and if that’s still not working?    
they will rage, cry and harrass you.   
And now even their “loneliness” is your responsibility? Fuck that. Honestly we’ve had enough, we’ve seen enough. Stand still and go on with your life!

"I'm a Korean American who has never lived in Korea, but I need to start my national military service. How can I increase my chances of getting into KATUSA? ","In January I have to start my national military service. I was born in the United States and have never once lived in Korea. I am a dual citizen so my parents want me to serve my two years. I'm really worried that military service in a foreign country is going to be really hard for me.

I've heard about KATUSA and I feel like it would be the best fit for me. I do understand that it is completely based on luck, but I want to take any measures or steps that I need to take to increase my chances of getting in. I'm kind of desperate here for answers, and just the thought of leaving my family, friends, and university behind for two years is terrifying. Any input would be greatly appreciated!

EDIT: For those telling me to withdrawal my Korean citizenship and not go, I appreciate your concern. However, that option is out of the table because my parents own property in South Korea and me not having Korean citizenship complicates the inheritance process. Also, I am a college student. I am still financially dependent on my parents.",471,285,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/1dih3iq/im_a_korean_american_who_has_never_lived_in_korea/,2024-06-18

quote

South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol declared an ""emergency martial law"" on Tuesday, accusing the opposition of paralyzing the government with anti-state activities.

In a surprise late-night TV address, Yoon said the move was needed to protect the country. He also accused the left-leaning opposition of being sympathetic with North Korea and vowed to ""eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.""

""Through this martial law, I will rebuild and protect the free Republic of Korea, which is falling into the depths of national ruin,"" Yoon declared in his speech, without specifying how the martial law would be enforced.

Yoon also asked South Koreans to have faith in him and tolerate ""some inconveniences"" as he vowed to ""eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country.""

Following Yoon's announcement on Tuesday, all political activities, including political associations, rallies and demonstrations, will be prohibited. Media and publications will be subject to the control of the Martial Law Command.

Hasan talking about Korea pissed me off more than anything he has ever said (+South Korea rant),"Korean American here. Yes, you could easily make the argument that South Korea is quite misogynistic for a first-world country. But talking about how the average Korean man wants to soak the street with the blood of women in the same stream where he glazes literal Sharia law nations with misogyny legally built into their system actually makes me want to shoot myself.  
  
South Korea's ""gender war"" is probably more complicated than the Israel-Palestine conflict. I'm being serious here. Heck, policy-wise, South Korea isn't even doing that poorly. It's ranked the world's top 10 best nations according to the Gender Inequality Index. No, the vast majority of the gender war happens in online forum spaces that polarize and radicalize people into one extreme or the other, where one side thinks the SCUM manifesto was based and the other side thinks Andrew Tate is based. The older generations (most of the population) don't even think sexism is that big of a problem or that there's a gender conflict happening at all, so it's almost exclusively a young people thing.  
  
Also, the state of the Korean far-left is wild because you'll have a Korean lawmaker talking about banning video games featuring anime characters wearing ""lewd outfits"" such as miniskirts and stockings (yes, he really said that) and somehow the Korean ""feminists"" will cheer this on to ""own the incel pedos"" (which doesn't make any goddamn sense coming from a feminist?) And don't even get me started on the absolute disaster that was the [Hyehwa Station protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyehwa_station_protests) (5-10 minute read). Just this past week, protests at Dongduk Women's University caused a minimum of 4 MILLION DOLLARS in property damage to the school.  
  
South Korea's deeply entrenched neoconfucianist social views should be the easiest slam dunk for any social rights activists or protestors, but Korean feminists keep fucking it up somehow by being too sexist, too incompetent, or both. And thanks to their sheer incompetence, the fight between feminists and misogynists has become unapproachable by the average person, who doesn't want to support either of them because both sides seem utterly insane.  
  
So it's extremely annoying when someone like Houthi-loving, Jew-hating, Russia-glazing Hamas Piker over here who probably doesn't know a goddamn thing about South Korea or did ANY research on the subject aside from reading a few tweets here and there on it acts like he knows all there is to it and confidently asserts wild shit like ""the average Korean man wants to kill women."" I despised Hasan Piker for the longest time, but this is probably the first time I was genuinely furious at the man.

Animal rights group drives birds into extinction in South Korea,"I am an ordinary South Korean middle school student who is very interested in biology. It may seem strange to see an Asian student suddenly asking for help, but I'm writing this because an endangered bird is on the verge of extinction by public and media irrelevance and hypocritical animal rights groups. The situation seems difficult to resolve on its own in South Korea, which is why it is trying to convey this message to 3 million unseen foreigners.


At the southern end of the Korean Peninsula is a small island called Marado. The island, which is first reached by numerous migratory birds passing through Korea through the Korean Peninsula, is visited by migratory birds who have completed a long journey every spring.


Synthliboramphus wumizusume, commonly called the Japanese murrelet, is a special species among birds that come to Marado. It is estimated that there are only 5,000 to 10,000 birds left in the world, like sea otters, floating on the sea all their lives, and They come up to the ground only during their breeding season. They build nests in steep places like cliffs and lay one or two eggs, and their young do not come up to the land until they are mature enough to jump into the sea and reproduce as soon as they are born. In other words, for them, 'island' is the minimum condition necessary for reproduction and species' survival.


But these precious birds are now in danger by an ecological disturbance in Marado Island. It's a cat.


The world's notorious ecological disturbance, the cat, is an invasive species believed to have been brought into Marado by humans to fight off rats. These cats have grown in number very quickly through food given by islanders, and as a result, they are causing serious damage to migratory birds visiting the island. For example, Locustella pleskei, which is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list, is reported to be severely damaged by cats in Marado. The same is true of Japanese murrelet.


According to Marado's Japanese murrelet population viability analysis following the neutralization of street cats, if the maximum number of cats is more than 80, Marado's Japanese murrelets are estimated to be extinct within 20 years.

Nevertheless, only the 'TNR' policy was implemented for the cats. TNR stands for Trap-Neuter-Return, literally capturing and castrating cats back into the wild. However, numerous papers have shown that the TNR policy is meaningless in reducing cat populations and does not inhibit the hunting of stray cats.


In addition to feeding street cats, TNR was conducted for three years, and according to the tally in May 2022, there are estimated to be 117 street cats in Marado. These figures are also estimated by non-professional animal rights groups, and the actual number of street cats is likely to be higher. Again, at this rate, Marado's Japanese murrelet is likely to be wiped out in the next 20 years.


Recently, due to the influence of YouTube and the bird-watching community, opinions have increased to protect Japanese murrelet. Thanks to him, high-ranking officials in the Republic of Korea were interested in the situation, which led to a meeting on January 31 this year to move the island's cats out of the island. Many bird enthusiasts in Korea were enthusiastic about this, and everything seemed to go smoothly.


But the outcome of the meeting was the opposite of what was expected. In the results of the meeting, it was decided that various experts and animal rights groups would launch a consultative body on February 10th, without anything related to the migration of cats. They claimed that they would come up with cat control measures only after monitoring and collecting opinions from local residents. Control measures, such as migrating cats, should have been implemented before February when the Janese murrelet arrives in Marado, but under the current circumstances, it is not possible to protect the ducks that will be harmed by cats.


The majority of animal rights groups in Korea argue that feeding street cats is ethical, and it is natural to be outdoors. And they believe in the effects of TNR, saying that there is no harm to the ecosystem of street cats. They also make contradictory statements that street cats are good animals because they catch mice and that TNRs do not hunt wild animals.

Numerous animal rights groups and individuals in Korea accuse conservationists of not feeding street cats to preserve wild animals or raising them at home as animal haters. And they hide behind anonymity and bury them socially. They cyberbulled professors and journalists who studied and reported on street cats, and even an animal rights group destroyed motion-sensing cameras installed in the field, disrupting investigations into street cats.


However, despite their violent behavior, many people and government agencies believe that animal rights groups represent the weak, so there are no sanctions against them. Their influence in Korea is considerable. There is also very little public interest in wildlife. Therefore, the value of conservation of wild birds against cats is easily ignored. Conservationists in Korea have been warning about the adverse effects of street cats on biodiversity for many years, but they have only been stigmatized as animal haters.

I do not lying, and it's realy serious situation.

I wrote this post because I thought I should let foreign countries know about this in this desperate situation. Many of Marado's endangered migratory birds must be preserved. Another purpose of this article is to promote the hypocrisy of animal rights groups in Korea to the world and encourage people to act. If this article is to be worthwhile, it needs to be delivered to more people. Please convey my voice and this message to your friends, family, and major media and wildlife conservation organizations as much as you can. If you love the Earth's ecosystem and animals, please help protect the birds of Marado.

Please.

"Damwon isn't just ""another Korean team"" They are the ultimate ""Challengers"" from Korea.","Worlds and its casters try to put them as some ""another good Korean team that are just there"" and try to portray them as ""revenge seeking Koreans"" but they really have their own narrative, and it is a good one, too.   
This will be a long one, but hear me out. This will be worth the time, if you are interested.  


Damwon gaming's name first showed up in the Challengers League (basically 2nd tier league) in 2018. However the team was founded on 2017 for Club Series(3rd tier league), and showmaker and his teammates won the Club Series 2017, winning their spot in Challengers League in 2018.   


Every step by step taken by DWG was as the Riot Games wanted how the pro-gaming scene to grow in South Korea, and they were always challenging for the very next goal that the Riot Games had in planned for them.   


Another good example of Riot Game's progamer youth system would be Wadid. He also started as Diamond support player to do well in Club Series, then to Challengers and all the way to Worlds with G2. It is almost a fairytale of how a Diamond player from Busan can go to Europe and show the world what he is capable of.   


Now back to DAMWON.   


In 2017, they started as Mirage Gaming with 5 gamers that were rather well known in high rank solo-Qs. After their first season in Club Series, they got the ticket to the Challengers League, winning vs Team Battle Comics (which also happens to join the LCK next season, winning the seat last month in the qualifiers).   


Their first season in the Challengers League was rough, to say it nicely. They weren't getting wrecked, but they weren't doing the best as well. They got the 5th place, which gave them no chance at the playoffs that season. That's how their first year ended.  


In 2018, they started strong in the Spring season, and they were definetly better. However they also had their arch-enemy, the Griffin (yeah that Griffin at the Worlds last year). They got the 2nd place in their league, but the in the playoff, they lost their chance to prove themselves, losing to the Ever Eight Winners in quarterfinals.  


Never giving up, right after Griffin made their way to the LCK, Damwon dominated the Challengers League in Summer. After winning the 1st place in the league, they also won the champion seat in the playoffs, and eventually earned the LCK seat as well, beating BBQ Olivers which that time had Ghost(current ADC of DWG) as their ADC and sending them to Challengers League.   


Even after their successful journey from 2018, they never stopped their challenge. Even though not as impactful as their ""senpai"" Griffin, they held their ground and got to the post-season playoff as the 4th place of the season. Even though they lost to Kingzone in playoff, their challenge continued to Rift Rivals where they showcased their talend brilliantly, winning against JDG with their physical and mechanical prowess and late game big fights.  


The Summer season went quite well for them, one could say, earning the 3rd place, a place higher than the last season. But the really important event that took place here is that they won the Worlds ticket after 3:2 victory against forementioned Kingzone. With the sweat smell of revenge, it felt great to be a Damwon fanboy because they are going to Worlds during their first year in LCK.  


After getting called ""scrim gods"", they didn't perform as well as their reputations had it. They indeed shown some really promising plays and aggressive playstyles, but they were a rookie team and could not handle the fast paced intellegent plays from G2. But most importantly, they learned their lesson, and never gave up. They were promising revenge against G2 the moment they went back to LCK.   


But, getting a revenge on a formidable and experienced foe like G2 isn't an easy feat. They had to figure out what they were missing, and what their weakesses were. So they struggled pretty hard during the 2020 Spring season. Earning 5th spot in LCK wasn't really what they were going for, but they constantly tested their picks, and kept honing their aggressive playstyles. That led to very entertaining series against KT and DRX which at this point is the DRX you know this year(true successor of Griffin with Chovy and CVMax). Even though they lost against DRX, DWG realized their flaws and started working on them.  


So, the curtain for the final play has risen. During their 2020 Summer season in LCK, they dominated. No other word could discribe their performances. Players comeing back from Mid Season Cup(Rift Rivals replacement regional matches) definitely improved their weaknesses. Nuguri now didn't die while pushing without solid evidence of his safety. Canyon toned down his aggression while keeping the intelligent counter jungling capabilities. Showmaker now lanes with everything in mind, coaches were amazed at how many things he thinks about even before just clearing a minion. Ghost and Beryl takes care of the stability of the team by providing ankor to rely on, and their mechanics have gotton to such higher levels that they were going toe to toe with Deft and Ruler bot lanes.   


Now they are here at the Worlds, trying to prove their ""2nd try is the charm"" magic.   
Riot Games layed out the map for Korean gamers who wanted to be the best in the world, and Damwon gaming took every step in that map, heading right towards the ultimate prize coming up to this point. From 3rd tier league to LCK in 2 years. From LCK to Worlds finals in 2 Years. Their challenging mindset and work ethic is worth the spotlight of this finals. I really hope Riot showcases this for all the ""wannabe Pros"" as the fine example of the path they carved and dedication they had shown.  


I hope the trophy goes to the better team this weekend, but I just wanted to tell people how Damwon Gaming climbed this ladder with their perserverence and hard work, through trial and error and learning from failures. This team is the true testement to LCK way of improving.

💎Reporting in from South Korea: Please acknowledge how strong we are TOGETHER🚀,"A quick introduction of myself, I was born in the States and was gifted with dual citizenship as my parents were Koreans. Though I was raised in the States, my parents were brilliant enough to constantly educated me to understand the culture, lifestyle, and ideologies of Koreans which helped me to gain easier access to get along as I am now working in Korea.

&#x200B;

As I am in Korea now, I was first able to find this meme, Reddit, stocks after the GME incident which was also all over the news and media in Korea last year. I am not here to generalize all of the Koreans, but the tendencies of culture movement and the fast-pacing lifestyle that the Koreans have are quite typical to be observed in everyday lives and these characteristics play a very important role when it comes to investments.

&#x200B;

The Korean stock market is also highly corrupted as the shorts from overseas including the same companies that are shorting on AMC are doing the equivalent actions to the major stocks in Korea and that the Korean Apes, so-called Ants, have endured for a VERY long time.

&#x200B;

Main Point:

&#x200B;

I want everyone to take a look at how many Koreans, only the COUNTABLE and VISIBLE ones, there are that are taking part in this revolutionary movement. What Adam mentioned about 3.2M retail investors are only referred to the US and Canadian investors and after you take a look at what I present to you below, it will mind-blow you for sure.

&#x200B;

Most Koreans use this Message App called Kakaotalk which is just like Whatsapp in the States. Within that App, it has open group chat rooms that you can easily search and find and I think this is a simple chat version of discord where ppl exchanges their thoughts and messages. I am currently in one group chat room that consists of 56 people as in the image below

&#x200B;

[ Private Disccusion Chatroom](https://preview.redd.it/cszpt6c6h8171.jpg?width=648&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f9cdf39380b2d32d036dda40ecc9a436f1e26a6)

&#x200B;

What brought our attention was to see how many stocks we have in our group chat room alone. The last highlighted box in the below image represents the total number of shares and the one above is the average stocks that our single room is holding. As we could not force everyone to expose their share amounts, we were only able to gather up to 45 out of 56 people. As you can see our single group chat room is holding a total of 163,482 shares with an average of 3,633 shares.

&#x200B;

[ List of share count](https://preview.redd.it/nh6nu88mj8171.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0211200012d8b7fbc29c0d7ff8d1ca8d6e52f0c)

&#x200B;

Then I looked and searched at the available open chat rooms by searching the word “AMC” and there are about 45 chat rooms that are about a total of 1900 people. This is ONLY a very small and limited way that I tried to find how many AMC investors there are that are ONLY COUNTABLE.

&#x200B;

[ When searched the word \\""AMC\\"" in Openchat room](https://preview.redd.it/ln0ztmefh8171.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdf6ba8924d6c0bd98ccb7fe8fc64e8c984724ce)

&#x200B;

A very conservative calculation I did is if there are 1900 COUNTABLE and VISIBLE people holding an average of 3700 shares, then it adds up to about 7M shares. I also asked the people in my chat room how conservative my calculation was and most of them said the minimum can be at least a double which is 14M shares that are being held by the Koreans at the moment. Though the statistics can be relatively off because of the limited information provided, what I know for sure is that the current retail investors outside of the US and Canada are only the surface of an iceberg.

&#x200B;

Please acknowledge the support, devotion, and strength that APES and Ants are fighting and putting together as a GLOBAL MATTER to correct what was supposed to be done a long time ago, destroying hedgies.

China's dislike towards South Korea is unreasonable,"As a Chinese dude from Australia, I don't understand why people in China sometimes talk shit about Korea. I could maybe understand why some Chinese elderly dislike Japan due to WW2, but I honestly do not understand why some Chinese people have this hateful attitude towards Korea...for what? In Australia, pretty much all the Chinese and Korean kids from primary school to university, share a social circle and respect each other. Korean Australians and Korean internationals alike have been very kind to me. As such, it's hard for me to relate to Korean haters in China.

Both in real life and on the internet, I see condescension, hate and ignorance in the attitudes of Chinese people in China towards South Korea. Like for example, if I say something good about my trips to South Korea to a taxi driver in China, they would just try and downplay SK compared to China. Another guy told me he didn't like South Korea and when I asked him why, he literally could not provide a reason...just said ""就是不喜欢""...like he doesn't even know himself why he dislikes SK?

Online, it honestly seems like Chinese people dislike Koreans for literally no reason? That or they find a bunch of ridiculous reasons such as claiming Korea is bad because 1 person thought Confucius was Korean. That or they try and downplay Korean culture/food/clothing by calling it Chinese originated or something. It's obviously just blatant disrespect? I rarely see Koreans who make outrageous or provocative statements against Chinese people. I honestly don't think South Korea has done anything to China to warrant ire from China. Don't they realize that Korea being on an upwards trajectory also affects China in a positive way?",311,482,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1alkmb2/chinas_dislike_towards_south_korea_is_unreasonable/,2024-02-08

"In South Korea, parents of autistic children are forgiven for killing their autistic children, and the South Korean government does not guarantee the happiness of autistic and deprives them of their happiness on the grounds that they are autistic.","In March 2021, in Incheon, South Korea, a father in his 30s repeatedly covered his autistic son with a blanket and rolled up the blanket to press it down on him, causing the autistic child to die. The Seoul High Court's second-instance court reduced the sentence of the father from five years to three years in prison.

On 23 August 2022, a 32-year-old mother in Daegu, South Korea, killed her 2-year-old autistic son with a weapon and then committed suicide by jumping off the balcony of her apartment.

On 12 August 2019, a mother in South Korea killed her autistic son by overdosing him with sleeping pills and psychotropic drugs, and the court only sentenced her to four years in prison.

[https://casenote.kr/%EC%9A%B8%EC%82%B0%EC%A7%80%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95%EC%9B%90/2019%EA%B3%A0%ED%95%A9365](https://casenote.kr/%EC%9A%B8%EC%82%B0%EC%A7%80%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95%EC%9B%90/2019%EA%B3%A0%ED%95%A9365)

 

On 9 September 2022, the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities expressed deep concern to the South Korean government about the cases of parents killing and committing suicide over their autistic children, and recommended that the South Korean government take measures. However, the South Korean government has not presented any measures.



In South Korea, people with autism are always exposed to the threat of murder and imprisonment. The reason for this is that South Korean society regards people with autism as a social problem. For example, in South Korea, parents who murder their autistic children are supported and pitied by society, even though they have killed their problematic children. In South Korea, even when documentaries and other broadcasts cover the reality of autistic people, the public tends to label autistic people as potential criminals who will commit crimes such as murder in the future and use abusive language towards them.



In South Korea, it is accepted that it is justifiable for parents with autistic children to confine their autistic children in institutions such as psychiatric hospitals or at home for the rest of their lives.

In South Korea, it is also accepted that it is justifiable for parents with autistic children to confine their autistic children in institutions such as psychiatric hospitals or at home for the rest of their lives.

 

Widespread eugenics is also prevalent in South Korea. For example, a column that says that if a woman delays childbirth, an autistic child will be born, and that autism spectrum disorder should be prevented before birth, is gaining public support in South Korea.



I was diagnosed with autism as an adult. As I became an adult, I was victimised by the barbaric discrimination against autistic people in Korean society.

I was in a relationship with a girlfriend who has an intellectual disability that accepts me. However, the South Korean government used the law to indefinitely confine my girlfriend in a mental hospital because she is mentally incomplete.

I was also forcibly confined to a psychiatric hospital.

Even though I was clearly diagnosed with autism, the South Korean government has not registered me as a disabled person. I am not covered by the disability law, but rather I am labelled as a mentally ill person, and I am at risk of being confined to a psychiatric hospital at any time.



I would like to ask all autistic people living abroad.

 

Please do not misunderstand that South Korea is a place where autistic people can live happily.

 

Even if you only know the reality of South Korea in a small way, the South Korean government will be able to demand improvements in the human rights of autistic people because of the eyes of foreign countries. Even North Korea, which conducts human experiments on people with disabilities, has recently been deliberated by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities due to the continuous pressure and demands of the international community. This suggests that the human rights of autistic people can continue to be improved through the solidarity of the international community and autistic people themselves.",698,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticPride/comments/1gzcv2k/in_south_korea_parents_of_autistic_children_are/,2024-11-25
